# Project Description
This project uses the Prohpet algorithm to forecast visitation at the five Utah National Parks. 

# About the Data

The source data for the project is from National Park Service. An example of the Zion data froms from here: https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/SSRSReports/Park%20Specific%20Reports/Recreation%20Visitors%20By%20Month%20(1979%20-%20Last%20Calendar%20Year)?Park=ZION. The data was pulled in April 2024, and thus contains visitation up through March 2024. 

# About the Algorithm

For this project, I use the Prophet algorithm created by facebook. It is a bayesian approach to time series forecasting that uses trend, seasonality, and holiday effects to predict future values. For more information, see the documentation [here](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/).
